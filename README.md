# CMPSC-400: Operating Systems

This repository contains my personal notes, code examples, and learning materials for CMPSC-400: Operating Systems.

## 📚 About

This is a collection of resources I've compiled while studying operating systems concepts based on [**Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)**](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) by Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau. The repository serves as both a learning tool and a reference for future projects.

## 📖 Topics Covered

The course follows the structure of OSTEP, organized around three fundamental concepts:

### Virtualization
- **CPU Virtualization**
  - Processes and process API
  - Limited direct execution
  - CPU scheduling (MLFQ, lottery scheduling, multi-CPU)
  
- **Memory Virtualization**
  - Address spaces and address translation
  - Segmentation and paging
  - TLBs and page tables
  - Swapping mechanisms and policies
### Concurrency
- Threads and thread API
- Locks and lock-based data structures
- Condition variables and semaphores
- Concurrency bugs and event-based concurrency

### Persistence
- I/O devices and hard disk drives
- RAID systems
- File systems and directories
- File system implementation (FFS, journaling, LFS)
- Flash-based SSDs and data integrity

## 🛠️ Code Examples

The code examples in this repository demonstrate key operating system concepts through practical implementations, primarily written in C.

## 📝 Notes

Notes are organized by topic and include:
- Key concepts and definitions
- Algorithm pseudocode
- Diagrams and illustrations
- Practice problems and solutions
